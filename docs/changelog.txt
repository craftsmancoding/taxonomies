Changelog for Taxonomies

Taxonomies 1.0.0
---------------------------------
Initial public release. 

Limitations: the feature set is somewhat utilitarian:

    * No sub-taxonomies.  A Taxonomy folder can contain Terms ONLY.
    * Drag and Drop interface in the MODX manager is not fully accurate.

1.1.0
---------------------------

- Support for sub-taxonomies (e.g. hierarchical terms)
- Support for hierarchical based searching.  E.g. searching for pages in the "Mammals" category returns pages in the "Dogs" category.

1.2.0
---------------------------

- New tab for "Pages" added to the Term pages: now it's easy to see which pages have been associated with any given term.

1.2.1
---------------------------
- Custom icons added

1.3.0
---------------------------
- Fixed hard-coded modx_site_content table name
- Added new parameters to snippets.

1.3.1
---------------------------
- Fixed one more hard-coded modx_site_content table name
- Updated Snippet DocBlocks for compatibility with updated Repoman property parsing.
